# Emmanuel Ayeniko - Media Beast Frontend Test Challenge Project

Welcome to my solution for the Media Beast Frontend Test Challenge Project! This project is a demonstration of utilizing Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS to create a responsive and modern web application.

## Project Overview

This project aims to showcase my proficiency in frontend development by implementing a simple web application design. The application is built using Next.js, a React framework known for its simplicity and efficiency, TypeScript for type-safe JavaScript development, and Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development with utility-first CSS whilst ensuring that the design was accurately translated into a web page.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive and compatible with various devices and screen sizes.
- **Next.js**: Utilizing Next.js for server-side rendering and other performance optimizations.
- **TypeScript**: Leveraging TypeScript for static typing, providing enhanced code quality and maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Employing Tailwind CSS for styling, allowing for rapid development and easy customization.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: The project follows a component-based architecture, organizing UI elements into reusable and modular components. This approach promotes code reusability, maintainability, and scalability.
